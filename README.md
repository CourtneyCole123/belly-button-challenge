<h1> Belly Button Biodiversity Project </h1>

<h2> Background </h2>

<p> In this assignment, I built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity using an external dataset (https://static.bc-edx.com/data/dl-1-2/m14/lms/starter/samples.json), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

This dataset revealed that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare. </p>
